## Description
I was tasked with creating a timed coding quiz with questions referring to material we have gone over so far in the bootcamp.

You are given a score based on if you answer a questions right or wrong. If you answer the question right, you get a point added to your score. If you answer wrong, time is deducted from your time. If the time reaches 0, game over and you're able to see your final score. 

The score is then saved to the local storage, and presented as the leaderboard.

## Installation
1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view webpage
3. Use a text editor to view all coding.
   

## Usage
Once you click the "Start Quiz" button, the timer will start and you'll be presented with your first question. Each question has 4 choices. 

If you answer correctly, you'll receive a point and move on to the next question.
If you answer incorrectly, time will be decuted and you'll move on to the next question.

After the time has reached 0 or you answer all the quetions, you'll be able to see your final score and type in your intials.
Those will both be saved to the local storage and displayed on the leaderboard.

While looking at the leaderboard, you can click either the "Go back" button to start the quiz over or "Clear highscores" button to reset the local storage.
